# Pysces

This is experimental code for quantum mechanics, in order to be used for teaching purpose.

The Pysces library created uses [Sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) and [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) libraries as a backend. This library is still in progress.

## Installation

1. Please make sure both Sympy and Matplotlib are installed, using the links above. 
2. Git clone this repository into the desired location.

## Contents

Note that the "Tutorials" folder contains foundations of quantum mechanics such as:

1. Commutators & Operators

2. Plotting Particle in a Box

  - Normalization
  - Expectation Values
  - Plotting

3. Quantized Hamiltonian Dynamics

  - Morse Potential
  - Gaussian Potential
  - Double Well Potential
