# Pysces

This is experimental code for quantum mechanics, in order to be used for teaching purpose.

The Pysces library created uses Sympy and Matplotlib libraries as a backend. This library is still in progress.

Note that the "finalized" folder contains foundations of quantum mechanics such as:

Commutators

Operators

Normalization 

Expectation Values

Plotting Particle in a Box

Computing Laguerre, Laguerre Associated Polynomials

Some of the other areas of interest are:

Spherical Harmonics, Harmonic Oscillators, Anharmonic Oscillators, Perturbation Theory

Ladder Operators
